# Pupil_Size_Prediction
 Machine Learning project in Python for Neural Network Workshop.The main idea is to predict the pupil size of different mice using the firing events of neurons and after analyzing the results with different techniques.

Extract the .rar file that contain the datasets. After that run .ipynb
